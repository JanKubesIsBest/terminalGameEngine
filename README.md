# terminalGameEngine
Game engine for terminal games

# How to create game?
Download the src folder and start experiencing my delicious code...
Too lazy to write a documentation... Maybe later.

# What is there:
Basic terminal animation, childs and parent system, collision map and detection shape and some other stuff...

# What is still missing and will be added (I hope):
Camera object (currently I am drawing whole map), more collision functions and then I will try to create shooting example game, but we will see about that.
